            - have a “Stake”
                - being impacted by an org
                - impact an org
                - competitors: Woolwooths and Kmart

        - Questions
            - How finely sliced/segmented should stakeholders be? (e.g. are the customers, suppliers, and supplier’s supplier all stakeholders?)
            - Are competitors stakeholders? (e.g. is our Business School café in the Abercrombie building a competitor with the gym café across the road?

    - 02 The Four Stages
        - Profit Maximization (PM)
            - According to Friedman (1970), profit maximisation is the answer! This perspective is very much embedded in what we call Classical Economics. While this may not be the most popular perspective today, it is still very common.
            - classical economics
            - maximize profit
                - `offshore`
                - US

                    - 21st Century
                        - hedgefunds
                            - `bigger shareholders` 
            - PM: outsourcing, or green packaging
                - 1. Shareholders first 2. profit (environmental problems)
                - 1. bad for society 2. probably bad for the company
        - Corporate Social Responsiblity (CSR)
            - After enough profit
            - Def: CSR are actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law (McWilliams and Siegel, 2001, p117).
            - Eg. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation: Giving back

            - CSR: beyond regulations and law
                - 1. good for the society 2. charity, foundation, donation 3. reputation
                - 1. not sustainable, not long-term 2. dependent on the available resources it can wield
        - Create Shared Value (CSV)
            - integrate the social programs
            - `leave it for the next time to complete` 
            - CSV: Starbucks
                - 1. corporate actions that both benefit the companies and the society
                - 1. can’t be largely implemented and probably only be limited to an extent 2.
        - Social Entrepreneurship (SE)
            - `embed` the social programs
            - Backgroud
                - industrialized world: unwilling: FREE白票
                - non-industrialized world: unable
                - Companies: responsibility→SE
                    - Sustainable Development (SD)→Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); EU - CSR
                        - World Commission on Environment and Development (1987), which says that SD is: bDevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
                        - the United Nations defined a set of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), based on a resolution adopted by the General Assembly in September 2000. These MDGs comprise eight specific, quantifiable and monitorable goals (with 18 targets and 48 specific indicators) for development and poverty eradication by 2015. Goals include human rights, health, education, and environmental issues. The efficiencies of markets, combined with the resources and managerial expertise of large multinationals, are considered crucial success factors in achieving these goals.
            - E.g.
                - Institute for OneWorld Health
            - SE
                - 1. entrepreneurship 2. be built in the first place 3. embed the social values into it Bangledesh bank: loan it to villagers and a group is liable for one person's behaviors?
                - 1. limited to small companies without a board, without a shareholders not longevity 2. low potential for growth

        - **Common critiques of this framework:** 
            - How to measure the generated value from each component?
            - By nature, it can deceive us into seeing an organisation as a linear supply chain.
            - It accommodates mainly to manufacturing of goods.
            - “It was created at a time when being big and having scale was in itself a key aspect to competitive advantage and profitability.” (Merchant, 2012).
            - It is hard to translate to smaller, more agile or nimble organisations.
            - It doesn’t distinguish between generic and distinct goods.

            - The Economist Chief US correspondent comments
        - limitations
            - The VRIN model has its limitations – it doesn’t take into account other factors such as networks, cause and effect relationships and catalysts. 
            - It also doesn’t address the creation and development of resources. Despite that, it’s a useful business tool for some scenarios.
            - The VRIN dosn’t consider new tech `static` 
                - Samsung water-proof
            - Inimitable: very costly to imitate what apple does
            - Disney isn’t renewing their streaming license. MONOPOLY
            - VRIN does not capture the future image: e.g. Disney plus
        - Learning question
            - Let's apply the VRIN framework to Facebook. Obviously Facebook is a thriving organisation with many resources. Let's consider Facebook's large user database. Whenever someone likes a page, posts a picture, adds a friend, this data is collected and stored by Facebook.
                - Is it rare or unique?→It is unique. Although other companies like Instagram and Google may have masses of user data, they do not have access to the same level of detail as Facebook. Facebook consumers interact with the platform in many different emotional situations. Google stores a lot of data as well, but it is not as nuanced, predicting our search pattern rather than our emotional behaviour.

        - rent seeking  __under the political__  
        - Rent seeking (or rent-seeking) is an economic concept that occurs when an entity seeks to gain added [wealth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealth.asp) without any reciprocal contribution of [productivity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/productivity.asp). Typically, it revolves around government-funded social services and social service programs.

            - For small-to-medium-size companies, increasing production can actually raise costs

                - [https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/resources/business-development/business-growth/economies-of-scale/](https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/resources/business-development/business-growth/economies-of-scale/) 
            - Answer: 
                - This happens because they don’t have enough resources to mobilize. If University of Sydney wants to increase his students intake by 30 students they can easily mobilize enough tutors and lectures to accommodate the needs. If University of Sydney wants to increase his students intake by 30 students they can easily mobilize enough tutors and lectures to accommodate the needs but for some universities like Caltech they can’t really do anything about the new intake
                - Economies of scale are not an inevitability. Some businesses models don’t lend themselves to economies of scale, such as those relying mainly on specialised labour. A carpenter that hand crafts ornaments may find it difficult to scale their business, because the business cost (materials plus labour) increases in direct proportion to the number of products sold.
                - There’s also a limit to economies of scale. Over a certain size, businesses might experience diseconomies of scale, where they become less profitable as they grow, not more. This might be due to factors like slow communication between departments or regions, lower motivation of workers in large companies, or difficulty in adapting to new circumstances.

            - Barriers to entry
            - supply-side economies of scale: require the incoming company to be of big scale
            - demand-side **benefits** of scale: (network effect): FB, I NEED IT! My all other friends are on it.

        - In business, many resources and dollars are at stake so strategy is important. One of the first books about corporate strategy was written by Chandler, a professor at MIT who wrote about how diversified businesses remain competitive.
            - Some other very early works in the 60s and 70s on corporate strategy include Andrews, and Ansoff, a Russian economist who migrated to the US. If you’re interested (many people find strategy fascinating), read more about the [Ansoff Matrix (Links to an external site.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansoff_Matrix).

        - Economic logic: ABC
            -  __System of subscription : it costs less to receive your refill sachet each month than to order one by one each timeWe should also brand this as a kind of convenience__ 
            - 70~80% less plastic
            -  __Loyalty to the brand ⇒ increase the profitsyeah, talking about market share people sticking with this product just cause they’re lazy__ 
            -  __Limited edition of bottle to initiate the projectAnd beautiful bottles__ 
            -  __Increase quantity of sachets bought so economies of scale takes place and costs are driven down as sachets are bought in bulk__ 
            -  __Charge premium prices for a higher quality version of the detergent, allowing greater profits as well as further specializationI think it can better work with bottles itself.__

        - meet the needs of current generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs by  __United Nations World Commission on Environment, 1987, p. 8__  
    - Five types of sustainability investment  
        - Integrated  
            - Systematic and explicit inclusion of ESG factors in investment decision making (drivers of risk and return)
            - You eliminate unsustainable types of businesses by choosing only ethical suppliers.
        - Screening  
            - There are three types of screening:
                - exclusionary/negative - avoiding sectors 
                    - e.g. gambling, tobacco, alcohol, fossil fuels
                - positive/best-in-class - positive ESG, sustainability performance
                - norms-based - minimum standards
            - Most of the money goes into  _negative screening_  because it's the most effective. For example, cigarettes are bad for health, yet these cigarette companies still thrive.
        - Sustainability themed 
            - building an all-round sustainable portfolio 
            - eg. clean energy, green tech, sustainability agriculture, green property
        - Impact/community investing  
            - targeted investments aimed at solving a specific social or environmental problem
            - this sector receives the least money because it is hard to identify social needs and create a business around that (refer to Grameen bank case study).
            - But, if you can find and address one fundamental need in society, there's a huge opportunity to make money.
        - Corporate advocacy and shareholder action  
            - shareholder power to directly influence corporate behaviour (corporate engagement, proposals, proxy voting)

        - **Eco-efficiency is where:**
            - A product/service is manufactured/delivered in a different way at a lower cost
            - Suppliers’ low opportunity cost is used.
            - **CASE STUDY: Industrial Ecology**
                - Historically, production processes in Quebec, Canada were inefficient and waste in chemical manufacturing would often be disposed of in the river.
                - In 2005, [Industrial Ecology](http://www.cttei.com/) launched an ‘Industrial Waster’ program which was an online marketplace for companies. Manufacturing companies were matched to buyers so that waste product of one company could be used by another as a useful input. This is called a ‘closed loop system’.
                - By 2014, there were 29 new exchanges operational, with 29 companies reducing wastage and river pollution. This change of process allowed companies to become more efficient and subsequently, cost competitive. However, this process was complex and required government approval and other procedures.
        - **Beyond compliance leadership** is most commonly adopted by companies.
            - It is where the competitive advantage comes from differentiation by focusing on organisational processes.
            - ![](local:///Users/nasa_william_lu/remnote/remnote-63774d368625a5e7827591af/files/NVDsfkYzClqOfjZsLuriwe_H2lMjWirgzegNMvoxwBZLGDl7gRq1JS-wICCtldcOBEj3HEn-0WcDf2U3F_cTEALm0ZUl1bt5KIJNGZ6fsA0xPDsC_SlqY7xUDav3sRvK.png) 
            - **Key features:**
                - There is a change process to differentiate the company, but not on cost side.
                - Company adopts an EMS (Environmental Management System); a certified sustainable strategy who set standards and activities to follow. Some examples are:
                    - CERES ([www.ceres.org](http://www.ceres.org/))
                        - UN Global Compact
                - Global Reporting Initiative
                    - The Global Reporting Initiative (**GRI**) provides organisations with a framework to guide sustainability and for others to compare performance on economic, environmental, and social performance. Check out what GRI does in the video below.
                - The company wants to create public awareness and inform customers about their sustainable initiative
        - **Environmental cost leadership** gives companies a competitive advantage by creating a new product and service which reduces cost.
            - It’s a complex strategy:
                - Differentiation is based **on a mo**re efficient product/service.
                - Strategy works well in a market with lower scope of differentiation
                - It can create a first-mover advantage, especially to leverage (future) changes in regulations
            - **CASE study: Ecolean, Sweden**
                - [Ecolean](https://www.ecolean.com/about/) is a package-manufacturing company. The packaging industry is a competitive market – no one pays attention to packaging brands – and there’s a lot of pressure on price and environmental performance.
                - So Ecolean created a unique new product and changed its manufacturing process. They substituted the typical plastic with a biodegradable chalk material that is not toxic.
                - Ecolean didn’t focus on the differentiation of its product. Rather, Ecolean’s message was about price reduction, which was counter-intuitive yet smart, because packaging is an undifferentiated market. Most consumers or companies don’t really care or are not willing to pay more if packaging is more sustainable or manufactured eco-friendly. So they pitched their product as cost efficient to appeal—you pay the same amount but extract more from it.
        - **Eco-branding** gives companies a competitive advantage by:
            - differentiating and creating a niche through ecology-oriented products/services
                - Capitalising on consumer’s willingness to pay (WTP) upward for trustworthy health products
                - Positioning products/services as a unique ecobrand that is difficult to imitate
            - **CASE: Änglamark, Sweden**
            - ![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/genial.ly/5d7863034d10ad0fd1c129f6/1580261811945-1580261811945.png) 
                - Änglamark, an innovative Swedish company, created a new organic brand of products, sold in a separate shop from ordinary supermarket products.
                - Änglamark began with a unique ecological brand to create financial value, as well as produce more organic, sustainable product. Consumers could trust the brand/supply chain to sell organic products because they are labelled as certified by IFOAM ([International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movement](https://www.ifoam.bio/)). This kind of eco-branding is difficult for competitors to imitate because it leverages strict IFOAM regulation and processes around organic products.
                - Consumers were willing to pay higher prices in a separate shop selling organic products, that was certified by an industry body. From an initial 20 products in 1991, it has expanded to over 300. Änglamark has communicated well its image of environmental responsibility - it is now known as [Sweden’s favourite green brand](https://mypbrand.com/2019/02/27/coops-anglamark-is-swedens-greenest-brand/).

        - The TBL consists of three **P**s: **profit, people**,** **and** **the** planet.** 
        - **People**
            - In the context of triple bottom line, people refers to every individual that is in touch with a company. This includes but is not limited to:
                - **Employees.** This means ensuring workers receive a fair wage in a safe environment that encourages professional development.
                - **Vendors.** This means ensuring a diverse set of suppliers are used and prioritizing small businesses or minority-owners when appropriate.
                - **Customers.** This means ensuring customers have fair access to products and their feedback regarding equity or safety are considered.
            - Traditionally, a company would prioritize investors or shareholders. Triple bottom line shifts the focus to individuals potentially not financially invested in the company but still tangentially involved with its operations. Now, instead of attempting to create value by only increasing investor returns, triple bottom line strives to create value by encouraging volunteerism of its employees or support or business success of small suppliers, for example.
        - critique
            - being too open ⇒ data leak / commercial secrets leak
            - long timeframe strategy may not be possible because of the pressure from the public
            - the framework is too general, but not specific. Refer to Nike's index. industry-specific
            - the framework is trying to touch on too many things
            - over-reliant on companies to give information
            - The system can be gamed: e.g. Columbia university feeds the US News college ranking report with false data. The indusry associations don't have authority to evaluate all the claims made by the company

        - Australia’s population 25.4 million
        - [Growth factor: Farrell’s triads](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/43432/pages/9-dot-3-rapid-urban-growth?module_item_id=1592420)
            - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Brandon-Lu737/Markdown-picture-hosting/master/11-2022/11_21_2022-22-08-37.jpg?token=AZVDNNC776FY6X7YLCIAEZDDPNOHE) 
            - **According to Farrell (2017), there are three factors:**
                1. Demographic factors
                    - measures the number of births and deaths.
                    - The higher the fertility rate and lower the mortality rate equates to natural growth.
                2. Economic factors
                    - refers to urban ‘pull’ and rural ‘push’.
                    - People are ‘pulled’ to urban centers by better jobs, improved infrastructure, faster Internet, wider choice of universities and so on.
                    - People are ‘pushed’ to cities by lack of infrastructure, lack of education, and limited types of jobs in rural areas.
                    - Urban in-migration leads to a net gain in urban increment
                3. **Political** factors
            - The government may propose a development plan to turn a town into a city. This calls for more investment, jobs and infrastructure which attracts more people. The town grows and subsequently, the government can reclassify it into a city. This can work the other way too! If a city starts to run out of people, governments can declassify them as a rural area, rather than metropolitan.
            - **There are also indirect contributions between these direct factors, including:**
                1. Natural Increase indirectly contributes to:
                2. a. Internal Migration: Net gain in rural births over rural deaths puts pressure on resources, leading to possible future migrants in rural areas
                3. b. Reclassification: net gain in rural births over rural deaths can push settlements beyond rural population thresholds
                    1. Internal Migration indirectly contributes to:
                4. a. Natural Increase: rural to urban migrants tend to be more fertile
                5. b. Reclassification: Due to lack of land, in urban areas, migrants settle on the outskirts of cities; eventually absorbed into city limits
                    1. Reclassification indirectly contributes to:
                6. a. Natural Increase: Rural upgrading through reclassification leads to improvements in public health, reducing mortality
                7. b. Internal Migration: Better connectivity and access to education can increase rural income
            - critique
                - different people and government have different standards of cities: e.g. Africa and Shanghai
                - urban growth: demographic
                    - able-body
                    - age
                    - education level
                - internal migration: look beyond the numbers
        - **How fast are cities growing?**
            - Several studies have researched urban growth patterns and impacts. For example, Dr Sandra Peter (2016) found that:
                - 1.5 million people move to cities every week
                - 85% of world GDP comes from cities
                - Cities are responsible for over 70% of total global carbon dioxide emissions (more infrastructure, urbanisation)
                - ¾ of the world's resources are consumed by cities!
        - **Megacities**
            - [PWC Links to an external site.](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/megatrends/rapid-urbanisation.html)did a recent study on New York, Beijing, Shanghai and London, and found these impacts are significant:
                - **Infrastructure**: these four megacities (New York, Beijing, Shanghai and London) need to spend over eight trillion dollars just to maintain and develop infrastructure over the next decade.
                - **Demand**: eight trillion dollars could create a lot of demand and as a result, many new jobs and services.
                - **Resources**: however increased jobs leads to heavy consumption. A lot of natural resources are needed to sustain these four cities.
                - **Aging**: some cities will start to shrink as more people in their cities are aging.
    - Global level growth
        - higher population = cheaper freight costs + less environmental issues
        - GMROF (Gross Margin Return on Floor)
        - Higher population density mean is better business
    - Information Communication and Technology
    - According to the OECD International Transport Forum, “ITF Transport Outlook 2019”, there are five core factors which drive disruptive change in transport, these are:
        - **Cost:** new technologies and/or processes make old ones uncompetitive in terms of production costs – the new ones become so cheap that old ones become unprofitable
        - **Quality:** new technologies and/or processes raise the quality of products or services to a level that makes the old ones uncompetitive
        - **Customers:** significant changes in consumer or business customer preferences make previous products or services unattractive compared to new ones
        - **Regulation:** new laws or regulations no longer permit old ways of working – for example environmental or labour protection rules – or allow new ways of doing things that previously were not allowed
        - **Resources:** previously important resources are no longer readily available or previously nonexistent or inaccessible resources now become available
    - Ex. Wing and Nuro
    - Smart Cities
    - Aging Population
    - Urbanization is measured by the area of business in agriculture, industry and services. (Agriculture relates to farming pursuits; industry is mostly about manufacturing and engineering; and services covers lawyers, doctors, hairdressers and so on.)
        - Low urbanization – increase in agriculture, decrease in industry and services
        - Medium urbanization – decrease in agriculture, increase in industry and services
        - High urbanization – decrease in agriculture; increase in services; steady industry
    - You could almost think of this as a formula: **higher level of services (professional) = higher urbanization = lower levels of fertility = higher levels of aging** . Almost, but not quite. Business is never quite that simple!

    - Climate Change and Urban Areas
    - Environmental impact
        - While generating 85 per cent of GDP, cities also contribute to 70 per cent of carbon emissions. GDP is very closely linked to energy – the more energy we use, the higher the GDP; and the higher the GDP, the more energy we use. Theoretically, this is a 1:1 relationship.
            - But between 1950-2005, global urbanisation grew by 20% and emissions from fossil fuel burning increased by 500%. This is an alarming statistic. Four factors contribute to this substantial growth:
                - Greater propensity of flooding
                - Storms
                - Droughts
                - Extreme weather fluctuations and temperatures.
            - **Furthermore, the same PWC study forecasts a global population of 8.3 billion by 2030. What do you think the carbon emissions will be by that time?**
            - If you are interested, you can read more here: PwC, (2015).  __A New Urban Agenda: Accommodating 2 billion new urban citizens.__  Rapid Urbanisation (UK).

        - According to the UN, most major cities are built where there is high danger –in terms of both natural disasters and economic vulnerability. The question becomes whether cities naturally grew or were planned to locate there.
- 10 Emerging markets
    - 10.2 Emerging markets
        - Definition of emerging market:
            - “An emerging market is defined as an economy with low-to-middle per capita income that is in transition to a more developed economy, characterised by stable and sustained economic growth and high standards of living.”
                - Blanco, 2008
        - Identifying an emerging market
            - “Absolute level of economic development, indicated by the average GDP per capita, the relative pace of economic development indicated by the GDP growth rate & the system of market governance and, in particular, the extent and stability of a free-market system; if the country is in the process of economic liberalisation from a command economy, it is sometimes defined as a  __transitional economy.”__ 
                - Arnold & Quelch, 1998
    - `What’s differences between emerging markets and transitional markets`
    - 10.3 E7 countries
    - The term “E7” was invented in 2006 by two economists: John Hawksworth and Gordon Cookson (PWC, 2006). The E7 (emerging 7 countries) are **Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, Mexico and Turkey**.
    - Some argue that the E7 will overtake the G7 over the next 20 years. What is your prediction?
    - 10.4 What makes emerging markets attractive?
    - Emerging markets are attractive as they hold the fastest-growing middle classes out of all economies. Demand for a variety of products and services in these markets will grow. In advanced economies, many of those demands are stagnant or are decreasing.
        - Outsourcing
            - call centers: 24/7 customer service
            - sometimes  __win-win__ 
        - Offshoring
            - Toyota
        - Potential for growth
            - China and India
        - Technical expertise or resource availability
        - Government incentives or subsidiaries
            - Low taxes for five years
        1. **Global Sourcing**: The procurement of products of services from independent suppliers or company-owned subsidiaries located abroad for consumption in the home country or a third country. For example, many Microsoft & Intel programming activities are conducted in Bangalore, India.

    - 10.5 Infrastructure
        - Increased consumption
            - When population increases, infrastructure increases. This graph gives us data on the different continents contribution to urban growth. You can see that all regions contributes to growth in urban demand, but China's share is the highest in key categories. There is an increased consumption of floor space, water, containers, raw materials, oil and petroleum.

        - Floor space, water and goods
            - The demand for residential floor space is expected to increase by 90% by 2025. As incomes rise the average number of people per household decreases. The demand for dwellings is increasing due to both population increase and smaller average household size. The demand for commercial floor space is expected to increase by 75% by 2025!
            - Sanitation is a key driver of early urban population expansion. As economies and populations expand the provision of water treatment infrastructure for drinking and sanitation also increases. By 2025, the increase in water usage will be 270 billion cubic metres per year (Sydney harbour volume is 562 million cubic metres). Cities in emerging economies will account for about 80% of new urban municipal water demand and wastewater treatment needs.
            - As you can see by the interactive chart below, water demand is on the increase!
    - Challenges
        - A risky business
            - Emerging markets can be risky with many challenges that are absent in advanced economies:

                - Firms are faced with additional social and economic costs when they operate in foreign markets (Zaheer, 1995). Additional costs of doing business with them include:
                    - Communication costs
                    - Resource costs
                    - Host government discrimination

                    - liability but not opportunities: so people can be blinfolded

                - UPenn
            - **Concept #2 - The CAGE Framework**
                - The CAGE framework is the distance between 2 countries as manifested along four dimensions, also the cultural, administrative, geographic and economic dimensions (Ghemawat, 2001). The main argument is that the strategy to enter a market cannot be decided on a country-by-country basis or on one size fits all approach. Rather, both similarities **AND** differences need to be considered.
                - **Cultural Distance**
                - Differences in values, languages, religion, social norms and trust.
                - **Administrative Distance**
                - Lack of common trading currency or political association, government policies, political hostility or closed market.
                - **Geographical Distance**
                - Remoteness, different time zones, weak or under-developed communication and/or transportation links, lack of a common border or sea/river access, and size of country.
                - **Economic Distance**
                - Differences in economic development level and consumer income; differences in costs and quality of natural resources, human resources, financial resources, infrastructure, intermediate inputs and information or knowledge.
            - **Going beyond LOF and CAGE frameworks**
                - Every firm either buys input(s) or sells output(s).
                - The input markets are:
                    - Labour
                    - Capital
                    - Product
                - The output markets are:
                    - Product (raw materials/finish goods)
                    - Services.
                - We need to build country specific understanding of multiple factors and build the ability to navigate through ‘institutional void’.
    - **10.8 Entering an emerging market**
        - Case study: KFC in China
            - premium pricing
        - Below are just some of the factors and questions to ask yourself before entering an emerging market.
            1. Political and social system (political structure, civil society) - Do you know the political and social system well enough?
            2. Openness (modes of entry) - Is the market open to having foreign investors?
            3. Product markets - are the product markets well-established? Is there a lot of competitiveness? Are people ready for your products?
            4. Labour markets - What are the labour markets? Do you need inexpensive labour or skilled labour with a particular language and education?
            5. Capital markets - What type of banks do they have operating? Would they loan money or support a foreign venture? Are you going to trade in their currency or use your home currency or maybe a mutual currency such as the US dollar?
        - Strategic choices for Emerging Markets
            - ![](Applications/RemNote.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/build/Future%20of%20Business%20c051604110734ab9a538a11c41232c90/Untitled%2031.png)

        - The core argument for a conventional approach is the **economy of scale** but there are challenges. Developed market products do not always meet the criteria of the emerging markets due to gaps in:
            - Income
            - Infrastructure (energy, transportation, telecom etc...)
            - Sustainability.
        - Reverse innovation
        - Another approach to doing business in emerging markets is reverse innovation. This is about generating successful innovation in emerging markets then, export the knowledge and innovations back to the developed markets. This approach can help to rethink the products and identify new markets for growth.

        - Challenges with reverse innovation
            - Challenges include:
                - Resistance to shifting power and control
                - Reshape the organizational model
                - The expectation of in-country team.
            - Project level actions
                - Establish radical goals
                - Practice clean-slate organizational design  __an absence of existing restraints or commitments.__ 
                - Leverage global resources
                - Choose team leaders without conflicting of interests.
            - Top-level actions
                - Rebranding the company’s future
                - Shifting people and power to emerging markets
                - Increase R&D spending in emerging market.
- 11 Design thinking
    - Definition
    - Damanpour, one of the most prolific writers on innovation, defined it as ‘the generation, development and adaption of novel ideas on the part of the firm’. His focus was on the organization.
        - **Generation**: You come up with a new idea, a new app or maybe a new computer.
        - **Development**: Someone else came up with the original idea, but you cultivated it into a tangible product. (e.g. buy an idea, motivated by different ideas)
        - **Adaption**. You adopt something novel from overseas and contextualize it according to your own market

        1. Invent the future
        2. Test ideas
        3. Bring to reality
    - Definition
    - 'Design thinking is a way of thinking that comes from a different way of knowing.'
    - Qualities
    - According to Tim Brown (2008), anyone can be a design thinker—from anthropologists to psychologists, and engineers, to management graduates — as long as they are optimistic and open-minded.
        1. Optimism
            - Optimism is being hopeful. Design thinkers need a fire in their belly which fuels the belief that there is a possible solution to every problem
        2. Empathy
            - Next, you get an initial idea or inspiration. The business asks a question, poses a hypothesis or identifies a problem by analysing market data, trends and other sources. Research identifies the user need. This can be done through market research, user research or design focus groups. The goal is to discover all the different types of problems faced by all the possible stakeholders. This is also known as the ‘phase of divergent thought’. If you wanted to redesign a university subject, for example, you would need to draw in all stakeholders, from tutors to students. Everyone would share what is working and what is not working.
        3. Integrative thinking
            - Integrative thinking means holding two (or more) opposing ideas in mind at the same time. You need to juggle multiple stakeholder interests and bring them together to form a universal solution.
        4. Experimentalism
            - Experimentalism is about prototyping. Don’t be embarrassed to create crude prototypes. You need to seek consumer or end-user feedback early and often so you can experiment and create new solutions.
        5. Collaboration
            - Collaboration involves working together. Steve Jobs didn’t make Apple alone. He had many other people who worked with him tirelessly to create this successful tech giant.
    - **Using Design Thinking to reason**
        - The design thinking graphic summarizes this logic and why we need different types of logic for different purposes and contexts. Which type of thinking comes naturally to you?
        - ![](Applications/RemNote.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/build/Future%20of%20Business%20c051604110734ab9a538a11c41232c90/Untitled%2035.png)
        - Design thinking logic
            - **Inductive**
                - Generally existing ideas
                - Generalize existing ideas
                - 1. Begin with prior knowledge of the problem or phenomenon, specific to a set of users of a service. (In our case, it is the riding passenger). 2. Gather some data about the existing ride-share service. To do this, you need to select a sample (pick a group of people from the general population) and ask them questions.
                    - 3. Analyze the data and scan for any patterns in the responses from which you can propose a relationship. Your solution is dependent on what your sample will pick up, so it's important to choose your sample well. If you start with a biased or skewed sample, there will be errors in your reasoning. When gathering a sample, you need to consider:
                        - Are the people a true representation of society?
                        - Is your sampling too ‘convenient’? (Did you choose people based on location, time of travel, or other criteria?)
                        - Are the candidates chosen randomly?
                        - Have you ch
            - **Abductive**
                - Combo approach to create space to generate new ideas
                - Design thinking
                - look at the simplest solution possible
                - The abductive approach revolves around stakeholders who understand the problem. However, abductive reasoning seeks **the simplest and most likely explanation** for observations **rather than a correct answer**, and so there always remains some uncertainty or doubt. For example, doctors make a diagnosis based on test results and jurors make a decision based on evidence.
            - **Deductive**
                - Narrows down from existing choices
                - Engineers reliable, safe, proven
                - Identify a general phenomenon. This could be a theory, fact or law that is widely accepted. Based on that theory, you make a prediction of its consequences.   Let’s apply deductive reasoning to the ride-share example. It’s generally accepted that single passengers have safety concerns about traveling late at night. You hypothesize that doubling the security of passengers will give you a commercial advantage.
            - **Inductive**`from observation to theories, which proposes a robust solution`
                - You begin with prior knowledge of the problem or phenomenon, specific to a set of users of a service. (In our case, it is the riding passenger.) Then you gather some data about the existing rideshare service. To do this, you need to select a sample (pick a group of people from the general population) and ask them questions.
                - Next you analyze the data and scan for any patterns in the response, from which you can then propose a relationship.
                - Your solution is very dependent on what your sample will pick up, so it's important to choose your sample well. If you start with a biased or skewed sample, there will be errors in your reasoning. When gathering a sample, you need to consider:
                    - Are the people a true representation of society?
                    - Is your sampling too 'convenient'? (Did you choose people based on location, time of travel, or other criteria?)
                    - Are the candidates chosen randomly?
                    - Have you chosen people across different demographics, age groups etc?
            - **Abductive**`start from shareholders' perspective`
                - You start by asking your stakeholders, 'How would you solve the problem?'. They may not have a clear-cut answer, but they may share valuable conjectures or speculations about the possible solution.
                - Ideally, you would arrive at a focus of discussion. It could be that passengers prioritize safety, cost, predictability and comfort. You then gather some data, as you would in the deductive approach. After data analysis, you may discover that safety is the key element of differentiation. As you are running that model again and again, you may uncover other interesting results. Perhaps, the cost increases with more security. This prompts you to develop a more nuanced hypothesis and run a new test. From there, you can propose a new relationship-you hypothesize a single passenger during the late night is ready to pay more so long as safety is assured. Finally, you create a new service with dynamic pricing, where the level of security will be proportionate to the price you pay.
                - The abductive approach revolves around stakeholders who understand the problem. **However, abductive reasoning seeks the simplest and most likely explanation for observations rather than a correct answer**, and so there always remains some uncertainty or doubt. For example, doctors make a diagnosis based on test results and jurors make a decision based on evidence.
            - **Deductive**`from theories to data, which in turn, corrects the theories, thus producing a robust solution`
                - First you identify a general phenomenon. This could be a theory, fact or law that is widely accepted. Based on that theory, you make a prediction of its consequences. Let's apply deductive reasoning to the ride-share example. It's generally accepted that single passengers have safety concerns about traveling late at night. You hypothesize that doubling the security of passengers will give you a commercial advantage. At this point, you don't know if this measure is right or wrong. To test your hypothesis, you gather and analyze a set of data.
                - Finally, you receive a confirmation that your data confirms your hypothesis.
                - The premise of the general law is most critical. The rules, laws and culture of a country determines what a customer expects. If the premise is not correct, the whole argument is flawed. For example, if a country believes security is not important, the whole reasoning will not flow logically.
        - `The first and the second one are the exact opposite`
    - Design thinking process 5 steps
        - Empathize Start by observing and engaging with the person for whom you are designing a product. Watch and listen.
        - Define Craft a meaningful and actionable problem statement. At this stage, you identify the core problem and your user's need.
        - Ideate The aim is to put forward crude ideas and as many problem solutions as possible. Try to 'think outside the box' and come up with many, alternative ways of solving the problem.
        - Prototype This is the hands-on stage. You produce many cheap, scaled down versions of the product or service with which a user can interact. You develop and refine the prototype, according to the user's need.
        - Test This is the chance to refine your solutions and make them better.
    - The Double Diamond (`think of it as a feedback loop`)
    - It’s diverging in discovering and develop, converging in define and deliver

        1. **Problem** First, you define a problem. Problems are unmet, frequently felt, urgent, unworkable and unavoidable. Your job is to identify and attack the most impactful or riskiest problem at your organization. You gather information from the problem side, the customer side and solution side and formulate assumptions and hypotheses.
        2. **Discover** Next, you get an initial idea or inspiration. The business asks a question, poses a hypothesis or identifies a problem by analyzing market data, trends and other sources. Research identifies the user need. This can be done through market research, user research or design focus groups. The goal is to discover all the different types of problems faced by all the possible stakeholders. This is also known as the 'phase of divergent thought'. If you wanted to redesign a university subject, for example, you would need to draw in all stakeholders, from tutors to students. Everyone would share what is working and what is not working.
        3. **Define**
            - The define phase is where you distill all your findings and ideas into a tight problem statement, **filtering out lesser alternatives.** You are trying to focus on one or two core problems and realistically aligning needs to the organization's business objectives. **During the define stage, you will develop, refine and prototype your ideas.** You come up with several ideas and then narrow them down. You present your findings to the company and receive the corporate 'sign off' or 'acceptance'.
                - financial constraints
                - legal constraints
                - governmental constraints
                - time constraints
        4. **Problem definition** You will then reach the problem definition stage. This represents a go-or-no-go point; the decision.
            - Upon reaching this middle point, the designer will say: "This is problem definition and here is what I want to do". If the organization approves your proposal, you will be given the financial backing or funding to develop and deliver the solution.
        5. **Develop**
    - The development stage is where you build and test prototypes. This often involves multidisciplinary teams, visual management and testing. You will also need to prepare a cost benefit analysis or pros and cons list, before you arrive at a final solution.
        1. **Deliver**
    - The final stage is where you complete and launch your solution in the relevant market. Your product or service is taken through final testing, signed off, produced and launched. The final testing is usually taken within a small, controlled market or sample. If you see that your product or service is working well, and receive positive feedback from the organization, you can deliver it.

    - Intrapreneurship
    - Before we explore theoretical perspectives, you need to understand the difference between **intrapreneurs** and an **entrepreneur**. Intrapreneurial teams are set up to experiment, innovate and create value from within an organisation. Many large companies now run in-house incubator or accelerator programs to support innovation.
    - Strategic adaptation
    - Let’s take a closer look at strategic adaptation of entrepreneurial strategies.
        - **Perspective**: an intrapreneur (employee) identifies opportunities, develops strategies, assembles resources and take initiatives.
        - **Entry strategy**: creates a new product or imitates existing product/service; sponsorship (customer, self or institution)
        - **Contingent factor**: intrapreneurs will go on an ‘experience curve’. They will try and fail a few times, but through the process, learn how to adapt.
            - Entrepreneurs produce many failed products
            - Search the number of failed products launched by Apple!
    - **12.6 Typical entrepreneurial challenges**
    - Opportunity costs
    - We call this **opportunity cost**.
    - For example, if you need to study for 2 exams the night before, would you focus on studying for one or both? If you focus on the one exam, you have a higher chance of passing that one but failing the other; if you study both, you risk failing both.
    - **Every decision has its own consequences** – every choice you make creates a unique path with different outcomes and unforeseen implications. For example, postponing the release of a new version comes at a price, and the method of sale has ramifications for production.
    - **How much should you trial in the first iteration? How many customers should you chase?** If you trial too much and fail, you might not recover. If you trial to less, you won’t learn or gain an understanding on how to move forward.
    - **Limitations of simple market test** – there is a difference between the trial in a controlled environment and repeated use in the real market.
    - Benefits of strategy
    - **1. Choosing a viable opportunity**
        - A low barrier to entry is not always good—if a business idea is easy to implement, your bargaining power is low.
        - A large market is not necessarily good—there should be a conduciveness in environment to support your venture, so you must first analyze the market. Consider your minimum viable product vs. long-term enduring return.
    - **2. Staying focused on the prize**
        - As a company evolves, the team may lose focus
        - Many companies spread dangerously thin with various ventures and this injures their business
        - Strategies should align the entire organization to the bigger goal.
    - Quote from Alexander Graham Bell
    - When one door closes, another opens; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us.

            - Importance of Lean Strategy
            - Lean strategy helps a free-flowing entrepreneurial mindset by bringing in a financial and analytical perspective. It’s based around these concepts:
                - **Vision**: All entrepreneurial ventures start with a vision. Founders choose the business’ reason for existence. (E.g. Apple wanted to create a product that was playful and sleek).
                - **Analysis**: Your vision needs to be realistic, so you need to examine internal resources and the external environment.
                - **Deliberate strategy**: this is where you create the firm objective, scope and competitive advantage in your business. It becomes a working progress where you learn. You make daily decisions, conduct experiments guided by the strategy, bounce off ideas, try to set up in market and make new findings.
                - **Emergent strategy**: As you learn, and receive more feedback from the market, you develop a more defined strategy.
        - **Steps of lean strategy**
            - The core methodology of being lean is the **Build > Measure > Learn cycle**, a r**apid feedback loop of ideating**, experimenting and evaluating to find a great product-market fit. **Also corroborates to Unilever’s fail fast fail forward.** 
        - **Properties of lean strategy**
            - It works better with  _end-consumer products_ , the  _innovation_  
    - 12.8 Know your business model
        - Definition:
        - Simply put, the business model is the way a firm operates.
        - **Building a brand**
        - Companies work hard to create a brand image that allows consumers to identify them in the market. Companies form a business model based on what results or consequences they want to achieve. For example, the behavior and language of the sales representative is fundamentally different in companies.
        - ![](Applications/RemNote.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/build/Future%20of%20Business%20c051604110734ab9a538a11c41232c90/Untitled%2038.png)
        - How does it work?
        - The business model is about making various choices and looking at their consequences.
        - Choices fall under:
            - **Policies**: how the organization is run
            - **Assets**: what you buy as input, and
            - **Governance**: how you apply policies against resources and assets
        - **Consequences involve the fixed or flexible effect of choices.**
            - Do you think giving someone an incentive will invite more cooperation or neutrality?
            - If you increase the price, will sales go up or down?
            - Business model is all about creating decisions and handling consequences? Do you think a company can hold onto multiple different business models under one organization?
        - The four main characteristics of a good business model are:
            1. **Alignment of goals**: you need to align your business model with your company vision. For example, Linux positions itself as an open-source company, whereas Microsoft is a broker company. Therefore, their payment model is different.
            2. **Reinforcement or internal consistency**: if you want to sell a product at a low price, you may want to invest more in marketing. In doing so, you need a business model with an economy of scale. You need to balance your business processes.
            3. **Virtuousness**: This refers to the positive feedback loop – business models should gain strength over a period of time. Other companies may even end up copying certain features. *Refer to Intel case study (second video)
            4. **Robustness – over time, your business model should still be effective.**
        - **Eg. Intel**
